## Introduction

This report looks at various data about Latine students living on in UCLA dormitories from 2021-24. We
utilized responses to Rate the Hill 2023-24 along with demographic data from the 2021-22,
2022-23, and 2023-24 UCLA academic years.
This report further aggregates data about Latine students into smaller subgroups: Mexican and non-Mexican in order to understand deeper nuances between ethnic identities.
